To run the project, install dependency and start the server.

```
npm start
```

It is divided into three sections `navigation`, `main content`, and `footer` on the main page. 

I didn't use the pictures you provided in the sketch file because I haven't figured out how to get the pictures out of it. I used some from Unsplash pictures and hope you don't mind.

I had a look at bootstrap grid and styled component, they look good, but I think all of these can be done using Tailwind perfectly and succinctly so I used it instead. Ideally I want to use less CSS and most things can be done with TailwindCSS.

I have added some hovering effects on buttons and arrows to make it more interactive. The mobile view will adjust the contents depending on the width of the screen. I haven't finished the last bit but you can see the layout.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. Thank you!
